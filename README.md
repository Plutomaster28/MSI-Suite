# MSI-Suite
MSI Suite (Meisei Service Intelligence) is the earliest Meisei Program that exists that isn't lost. In real life this was a project a friend and I worked on for computer class, but I've decided to make it public source since we no longer need it.

# How do I run it?
Just like Zora-DS and Zora 95, it is a `x3` program (set of 16/32-bit programs), menaing to run it, you have to use your own command line interface to run the python application.

It's easy! Simply go to the directory that has your files, and run `python main.py`

# Why doesn't Weather or News work?

Those functions used APIs that required me to get a key for, to use them, you have to get your own key. Which thankfully, is free!
